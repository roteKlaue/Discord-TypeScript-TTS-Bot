1. Sign in/Sign up to MongoDB
2. Create a new cluster (free tier is fine)
3. Create a new database user with username and password, and give it read/write access to the database. YOU CANNOT CREATE A USER WITH A TOKEN, YOU MUST USE A PASSWORD.
4. Whitelist your IP
Go to Network Access, click on "Add IP Address", and add your IP address. You can find your IP address by going to [this website](https://www.whatismyip.com/). If you are using a VPN, you will need to whitelist your VPN's IP address.
